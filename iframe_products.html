					<h2>Ceramic and rubber composite series</h2>
					<p><span class="textStrong">Applicable scope</span></p>
					<p>Ceramic and rubber composite lining has both the high wear resistant of ceramic and impact resistant of rubber, suitable for the wear resistant equipments of bulk material transport system. Such as the coal hopper, coal pipe, outlet and inlet pipe of the miller.</p>
					<p>Ceramic and rubber composite lining is using the hot vulcanize technology, vulcanizing the ceramic and rubber together. Then, install the ceramic and rubber linings onto the equipment surface by adhesive. It has both the advantage property of ceramic’s high hardness and rubber’s soft ability, can solve the wear resistant problems of equipments of block material transport system. Because of adding of rubber, the product has the good performance of wear resistant and corrosion resistant as well as reduce the down time cost and reduce the noise.</p>
